   - Slides at 20 times magnification with 600+ slides. This was compared with 10X and 20X magnifications. 
     Double magnifications performed better on 13 of 15 test cases of the three tasks. 
     In some cases, accuracy was higher by 10%. This was justified because of limited number slides per class.
   - Caveat: the single magnification patches (10X) were extracted using the original implementation of the graph transformer (paper 1 in the reference) and the double magnification using paper 2 in the reference. Even though both papers use simclr for feature extraction.
   
October 2022:
    - Annotation of 1434 slides was completed. The patches were tiled to the size of 244 X 244 in low magnification (5X) and high magnification (10X) and saved in WSI and WSI_test_set.
    - Training and testing for 2, 3, and 5 class classification completed using 10 fold cross validation (around 0,5 % improvement relative 5 fold cross validation)
    - Training and testing for 2, 3, and 5 class classification completed using 5 fold cross validation
    - Training and testing for low and high magnification for 5 class classifications completed.
